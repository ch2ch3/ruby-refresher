Ruby Refresher
==============

This week we revisited the basics of Ruby. We were given a set of tests to work through, ranging from removing 'nil's and false from an array, to finding out if a particular date was a bank holiday. As an extra exercise, I also wrote a method to print the lyrics to [99 Bottles of Beer](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html).

How to use
----------
Clone the repository:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:ch2ch3/ruby-refresher.git
```

Change into the directory:
```shell
$ cd ruby-refresher
```

To run the tests:
```shell
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
```

To run the script for 99 Bottles of Beer:
```shell
$ ruby beer.rb
```
